Ideas to further improve the screen:

- if a build fails, show it big above all the other stuff instead of just changing it's color to red
- show proper durations (e.g. 508min -> 8h 28min)
- make number of last builds to show configurable
- make number of highest rated projects configurable
- make number of lowest rated projects configurable
