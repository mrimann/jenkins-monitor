Ideas to further improve the screen:

- if a build fails, show it big above all the other stuff instead of just changing it's color to red
- make number of highest rated projects configurable
- make number of lowest rated projects configurable
- during a currently running build, dont show '0min ago"
- if the latest build is <1min ago, show "now" instead of "1min ago"
