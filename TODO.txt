Ideas to further improve the screen:

- if there are jobs that belong together, visualize this on the screen
	e.g. ProjectName (builds the package) is run first and if it successes, it's being deployed to a staging environment, the job is name ProjectName-Staging
- the duration since last build (top right) is strange during a longer job-run
- add a nice screenshot to the README to be shown on GitHub :-)
