Ideas to further improve the screen:

- if a build fails, show it big above all the other stuff instead of just changing it's color to red
- during a currently running build, dont show '0min ago"
- if the latest build is <1min ago, show "now" instead of "1min ago"
- hide jobs that had no build during a configurable amount of days (e.g. hide all jobs not built for the latest 30days)
